# TTL255.com PyTips

In PyTips I'll be talking about Python features, standard libraries, and interesting packages found on PyPi. The idea is to have a short write up and accompanying code snippets for all Python things that I found useful and interesting. These will be mostly aimed at beginners, and I hope that you too, my reader, will find them helpful.
